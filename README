NAME
    File::Edit - A naive, probably buggy, file editor.

SYNOPSIS
        use File::Edit;

        # Replace string in file
        File::Edit->new('build.gradle')
                  ->replace('minSdkVersion 16', 'minSdkVersion 21')
                  ->save()
                  ;

        # Edit text, save to file
        File::Edit->new()
                  ->text("  minSdkVersion 16\n  targetSdkVersion 29")
                  ->replace('minSdkVersion 16', 'minSdkVersion 21')
                  ->save('build.gradle')
                  ;

        # Swap lines, save to file
        File::Edit->new()
                  ->text("  Do this first\n  Now do that\n  Don't do this")
                  ->swap('Do this', 'do that')
                  ->save('todo.txt')
                  ;

        # Insert at line index, save to file
        File::Edit->new()
                  ->text("  Line index 0\n  Line index 1\n  Line index 2")
                  ->at(1)->insert('  Inserted line\n')
                  ->save('todo.txt')
                  ;

METHODS
  new
        my $fe = File::Edit->new("some_file.txt");

        Reads in a file for editing.

  text
        my $fe = File::Edit->new()->text(some_text);

        Reads in some text for editing.

  replace
        $fe->replace($old, $new);

        Replace the $old portion of a single line with $new.

  save
        my $fe = File::Edit->new("some_file.txt");
        $fe->save();                # Saves to "some_file.txt"
        $fe->save("other.txt")      # Saves to "other.txt"

  swap( $text_1, $text_2 )
    The swap($s1, $s2) method finds the line containing string $s1 and finds
    the line containg string $s2 and swaps both lines.

  at( $idx )
    The at($idx) sets the index for which actions such as insert($line) will
    take place.

  insert( $line )
    The insert( $line ) method inserts the $line at the index location
    specified. The index location is typically by an earlier call to
    at($idx). For example:

        $self->at(0)->insert('Start of file')
